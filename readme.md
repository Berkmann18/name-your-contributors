> Name your GitHub contributors; get commits, issues, and comments

`name-your-contributors` gets all of the code reviewers, commenters, issue and PR creators from your organization or repo.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save name-your-contributors
```

### API Limits and setting up a GitHub Token

You also need to get a GitHub application token to access the API. Go here:
https://github.com/settings/tokens. Click on "Generate New Token". It needs to
have the `read:org` scope in order to search by organization. Name the token
something informative: `name-your-contributors` is a good name.

Set the token with the variable name `$GITHUB_TOKEN` before running the script:

```sh
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=ab34e...
```

You can also set the var automatically in every session by adding the above line
to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

#### Caveats

GitHub regulates API traffic by a credit system. The limits are quite high; it's
permitted to query hundreds of repos per hour using the `repoContributors`
function, but some organisations have many hundreds of repos, and a single call
to `orgContributors` could potentially exhaust your entire hourly quota. The
WikiMedia Foundation is a good example of an org with way too many repos for
this app to handle.

Unfortunately filtering by contributions before or after a given date has no
effect on quota use, since the data still needs to be queried before it can be
filtered.

For more details on rate limits, see
https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/resource-limitations/.

## Usage

### From Code

```js
const nyc = require('name-your-contributors')

nyc.repoContributors({
	token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
	user: 'mntnr,
	repo: 'name-your-contributors'
	}).then(//do something with the results
	)
})

nyc.orgContributors({
	token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
	orgName: 'ipfs',
	before: '2017-01-01',
	after: '2016-01-01'
	}).then(...)
```

### From the Command Line

```sh
$ npm install -g name-your-contributors

$ export GITHUB_TOKEN={your-token}

$ name-your-contributors -u mntnr -r name-your-contributors

$ name-your-contributors -o ipfs -a 2017-01-01 > ipfs-contrib.json
```

The output will be in the format:

```sh
$ name-your-contributors -u mntnr -r name-your-contributors --after 2017-11-10
